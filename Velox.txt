Velox MVA Framework

Velox is a MVA (model-view-adapter) software architecture that facilitates two-way data transfer between a database and a web frontend.
In Velox, only the view is completely handled by the browser. The model is maintained on the backend and is not directly influenced by
the client-side view. The adapter portion of this architecture is split along the client/server interface, with the data transferred
across the interface in JSON over HTTP. This actual transfer is handled mostly transparently, using JavaScript libraries client-side
and PHP libraries server-side (this can be ported to other server-side languages as needed). Using this framework, developers can focus
more specifically on UI on the frontend and database design on the backend, without having to worry about how the data gets from one to
the other.

This specific implementation of Velox is built with the intent of serving browsers implementing ECMAScript 2020 (11th Edition), with
the backend operating on a LAMP architecture using PHP8. Earlier versions of these languages may or may not be compatible with Velox
as written here.
