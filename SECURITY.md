# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
While Velox Server has at present no particular development calendar, the current major release and the one immediately
preceding (except pre-release) are officially supported and will receive security and bug fixes. Any versions prior to
these are to be considered end-of-life and will receive no further updates; therefore, it's important to update to the
latest major version whenever possible to do so.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
As this is an open-source project in development, there is no need at present to privately disclose the
nature of a vulnerability. These can be brought up in Issues, tagged as "security".
