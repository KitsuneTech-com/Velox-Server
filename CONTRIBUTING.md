# Velox Contribution Guidelines #

At the time of this writing, the Velox framework is only being maintained by Kitsune Technologies. However, this is fully intended to be a free open-source
project, and ideas and suggestions are welcome to improve this for the benefit of all who might use it. If you have something you would like to see implemented here, feel
free to introduce yourself in Discussions and open a topic for your idea. If you would like to contribute more directly, you can fork the repository and
create a pull request for the changes you would like to add. Outside contributors are encouraged to first bring these changes up in Issues or Discussions before
creating the pull request in order to make it clear what the request is for. Any unsolicited pull requests whose purpose isn't clear are likely to be closed
without action.

If you're contributing code and would like to be credited, mention how you would like to be credited in a comment with your pull request. If your request is
accepted and merged, this will be added to the list below. Additionally, if your work adds or makes major modifications to any of the classes or methods herein,
feel free to include a PHPDoc @author tag with your submission.

Note: if your contribution includes code from outside sources, be sure that you have the right to use the code in this manner and that the original source is properly
credited. Kitsune Technologies does not condone code theft, and if any code contributed is found to infringe on a copyright or license, it will be removed or otherwise
remedied, and the contributor may be banned from any further contributions to this or any other Kitsune Technologies project.
